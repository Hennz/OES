<div align="center"><h3>Associate Engineering Colleges - Why, 	Who & How</h3></div>
<div>Engineers Technologies’ vision is to bring Industry Knowledge and Practices to the reach of mechanical engineering students who are undergoing their BE/ B Tech/ ME/M Tech program in Engineering colleges and improving the employability prospects of engineering graduates in the Design and Engineering functions and creating ready to deploy CAD/ Product Design resource pool for the Manufacturing Industry.<br/><br/>

Use of CAD, CAM, CAE software is unavoidable and must for Design and Engineering functions in today’s manufacturing industry and that is why Engineering Colleges worldwide have included study of CAD CAM CAE software's in the Academic Curriculum for the Mechanical Engineering Courses. Today almost all progressive Engineering colleges have invested in softwares and established CAD CAM CAE departments.<br/><br/>

We have all the reason to believe that CAD CAM CAE labs may achieve their purpose fully if we are able to address the following few points religiously in Engineering Colleges.<br/><br/>

# Is the faculty engaged in teaching CAD CAM CAE software an experienced industry professional and teaches students anything beyond software commands?<br/><br/>

# Is any Industry Expert involved in the CAD CAM CAE training process and sharing Industry Practices, Application and knowledge with the students?<br/><br/>

# Are projects and assignments done during the CAD/ CAM /CAE training program anywhere similar to real Design and Engineering projects?<br/><br/>

# Are students able to learn and utilize CAD/ CAM/CAE softwares effectively in Engineering colleges and as per the industry requirements?<br/><br/>

# Are students employable in the Industry with only conventional CAD/ CAM/CAE software training offered at Engineering Colleges?<br/><br/>

The real Design & Engineering practices and applications are much more than the use of CAD CAM CAE softwares and Engineers Technologies endeavours to play an active role by collaborating with Engineering Colleges and leveraging its already established CAD CAM CAE infrastructure to bring the Industry knowledge and practices to the reach of Engineering Students by engaging Industry experts for imparting domain specific and Industry aligned CAD/CAM/CAE training.<br/><br/>

We urge Engineering Colleges to work with us as Associate Engineering College to train Mechanical Engineering Students who are seeking career opportunities as CAD/Product Design Engineer in the Automotive, Heavy Engineering, Aerospace and Manufacturing Industry.<br/><br/>

Engineers Technologies work with Associate Engineering Colleges on a revenue sharing basis and extend up to 25 % discounted fees to students from Associate Engineering Colleges.<br/><br/>
