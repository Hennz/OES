<div>In todayâ€™s Innovation driven world the Tools, Technologies and Industry practices are changing at a much faster pace in almost every discipline of Engineering . Adoption of Technological changes in the Academic Curriculum is not easy and most importantly making Academic Curriculum inline with specific Industrial applications and practices is another big challenge for an Educational Institution. On the other hand, according to survey reports employability of Indian Engineering Graduates has drastically come down to 20% ,which is quite disturbing and alarming for the Industry.<br/></br>

India is among the top recipient of outsourced projects in IT/ITES, Design, Engineering etc. and is growing much faster than its competitor countries. It is quite imperative that competent and Industry ready talent pool is the key to cater to the growing needs of the services business and every organization is putting considerable effort , time and money to get competent and ready to deploy resources in the respective Industry domain.<br/></br>
