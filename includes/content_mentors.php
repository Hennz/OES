<div align="center"><h3>Associate Mentors - Why, Who & How</h3></div>
<div>The objective of our domain aligned CAD Design Engineer training program is to train mechanical engineering graduates/under graduates with Design & Engineering knowledge required for New Product Design/ Re Design/ Design Modification program in the domain of Interior, Exterior, BIW,
Engine, Transmission etc. for Automotive, Heavy Engineering and other Manufacturing Industry.<br/><br/>

The real Design & Engineering practices are a way beyond the use of merely CAD CAM CAE tools and such industry specific knowledge dissemination can not be possible without active engagement and contribution from Industry experts by knowledge sharing with the aspiring mechanical engineering
graduates.<br/><br/>

Engineers Technologies is playing an active role in bringing the Industry knowledge and practices to the reach of Engineering Students by engaging Industry experts for training and not only improving the employability prospects of engineering graduates but at the same time creating a talented CAD / Product Design resource pool for Industry.<br/><br/>

We urge Industry experts to come forward and be an Associate Mentor to Train Engineering Students who are seeking career opportunities as CAD/Product Design Engineer in the Automotive, Heavy Engineering and Manufacturing Industry.<br/><br/>

We consider Associate Mentors as a valuable asset and work with them on a revenue sharing basis.<br/><br/>

If you are an experienced professional in any particular domain and interested in EmpoweringStudents by training them, please write to us at <a href = "mailto:INFO@ENGINEERSTECHNOLOGIES.COM">INFO@ENGINEERSTECHNOLOGIES.COM</a><br/><br/>
